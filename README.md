# Stock Alerts ðŸ“ˆ

**Stock Alerts** is a Python application that provides users with real-time updates on stock movements and relevant news, helping them stay informed about potential changes in stock prices. By utilizing the AlphaVantage and NewsAPI, the project pulls essential stock and news data, calculates percentage changes, and sends SMS notifications to users via Twilio.

## Features

- **Real-Time Stock Tracking**: Uses the AlphaVantage API to pull todayâ€™s and previous dayâ€™s closing stock prices.
- **Market Movement Analysis**: Calculates the percentage change between todayâ€™s and yesterdayâ€™s closing prices to determine if the stock is trending up or down.
- **News Analysis**: Fetches relevant news articles for a given stock from the NewsAPI to help explain recent market movements.
- **SMS Notifications**: Sends SMS alerts directly to users with stock updates and news summaries using Twilio.

## Project Workflow

1. **Stock Price Fetching**:
   - The application uses AlphaVantage to retrieve the latest stock prices for the selected companies.
   - It calculates the price difference and percentage change to determine the stockâ€™s direction (up or down).

2. **News Retrieval**:
   - Based on stock performance, the application uses NewsAPI to retrieve recent headlines for the relevant company.
   - This information helps users understand why the stock may have moved up or down.

3. **Notification via SMS**:
   - Using Twilio, users receive an SMS alert with stock performance details and a summary of relevant news articles.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-alerts.git
